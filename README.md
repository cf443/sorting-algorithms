# Sorting Algorithms
A collection of implementations of various comparison-based sorting algorithms. The eventual goal of the project is to provide visualisations of each of the algorithms, for learning purposes.

### To-do
The general structure of the project is still a work in progress. Features still to be implemented include an effective testing script for a generic sorting algorithm, with appropriate extreme cases (ascending, alternating etc.). The visualisation features will be developed when I have a domain to contain them.
